#### Description:
Trying to simulate a ER triage system by going through to determine if immediate medical attention is needed or not.Code used is flask,Llama3 and HTML,CSS. I used mostly old codes and edited them to solve the problem.Obviously it is not accurate nor do I have the skill to implement ML on data nor hands on large enough data set to draw relevant conclusion so I had to settle with a dictionary search ending with a extra back end just in case it could not handle. The hardest part was deciding on the database type and which symptoms to include how to categorize. What systems I want to use versus user friendly input system and what to compromise etc. I learned new things such as learning to integrate API into system call as well as various methods of grouping data, but mostly to reinforce concept in program design and also learnt the difficulty of building a machine learning an neural network so gave up that route. At the end I just want the user to see if they really need to go to the emergency room or not, save them a couple thousand of dollars. I use an combination of quiz, dictionary search from symptom to severity as well as age, final an outcome and log of the patient. This in term can be used to help Machine learning predict outcome for future triage system and maybe replace or help confirm diagnosis. Nothing really new here just reapplying what we saw in cs50 in the most recent period since all the previous concept are no longer fresh in my head. This gave more will to maybe learn later on machine learning and simulation etc. Happy holidays!
